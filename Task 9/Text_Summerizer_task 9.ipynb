      "            <a class=\"text-secondary\" href=\"../home\"> Blog </a> / <span class=\"text-muted\">Q&amp;A with Chibuike Osita</span></p>, <p>Hey guys, it's nice to be here</p>, <p>So my name is Chibuike Emmanuel Osita, but in the community and generally, I'm more commonly known as Mozart, I'm a software engineer and a proud aluminai of this internship. So I'm really happy to be in this space again.</p>, <p>In order to ensure this is organized, I'll talk about the following before the questions.</p>, <p>- Why I became a developer</p>, <p>- What I learned from the internship</p>, <p>- Becoming a product creator</p>, <p>- Why I created legohackers</p>, <p>- Things to focus on to improve your skills.</p>, <p><strong>Why I became a developer</strong></p>, <p>Let's start from the beginning very briefly, I wanted to be an aeronautics engineer, a since I was little, aside becoming spiderman, it's the only thing I found myself thinking about constantly. Until my dad got I and my brother our first computer, it was a compaq presario cq57, pretty old stuff, but it was the beginning for me, I spent a lot of time tinkering with it, installing games and deleting them.</p>, <p>Eventually, I started trying to edit them, I failed miserably, but I learned a little about what programs were, when got into secondary school I met a guy called Izuchukuw, who game me some ideas about programming, I could remember this well because he open youtube one day and told he hacked the internet to view the videos and I freaking believed him , Since then it's been me and computers and programming just felt right.</p>, <p>Before I got into programming actively was about a year after secondary school and I wanted to learn how the world works and an objective look at myself made me understand that I wanted to do this. as a career, so I worked at computer village for a year, before writing jamb for computer science and I got the admission. but the school (FUTO) didn't teach what I was expecting, so I started actively training myself, right around the first year.</p>, <p>I started with C++, one 1 hour everyday for a year, and then java before getting into web development</p>, <p>I wouldn't recommend this route though, all it did for me was to give me some grounded understanding.</p>, <p>If there was anything I would have done differently,</p>, <p>- I would have focused on learning more about what the languages themselves could be used for</p>, <p>- Focused more on design patterns</p>, <p>- mastering singular technologies</p>, <p>the key is to know exactly what you want from your career as a developer and what it would mean for you. For example, because of my enthusiasm, I learned different languages, some of which I didn't use at all (e.g C++), I did get to learn design patterns later, but I always felt I should have started somewhere around there in order to understand the bigger picture.</p>, <p>Singular technologies are all things related to a singular language and it's frameworks, it's everything that concerns the language you are working on, e.g PHP and Laravel, if you know PHP, master it and master Laravel , so everything concerning it as a language and its framework is in your circle of control and understanding.</p>, <p>at the end though, I'm happy about my path, but if you follow the key points, you'll likely get to your ideas faster.</p>, <p>before I end this sections (<strong>why I became a developer</strong>) though, just have the following in mind.</p>, <p>- Don't just follow buzzwords, at the end, all of these technologies are the same.</p>, <p>- And the simplest solution or language to understand and use is most likely the best for you (Occam's razor)</p>, <p>- Focus on the essentials, (is it understandable, does it work, how soon can I get up and running)</p>, <p>the essentials may be different for you, but always keep them in mind.</p>, <p><strong>What I learnt from the internship</strong></p>, <p>The internship started when I just finished my second year in school, the third semester was just beginning, we were more than a thousand, and I really loved it</p>, <p><a href=\"https://hngi6.slack.com/archives/CMGMWJE49/p1569508367323500\">15:32</a></p>, <p>before then I had known only a few other developers, but with the internship, I mad a new opportunity to meet some really ingenious people. we collaborated, fought argued and learnt together and it made me understand the following points.</p>, <p>- <strong>A team would only work if it's members are working</strong></p>, <p> - <strong>The leader of the team understand the problem, before the members can get to work</strong></p>, <p>- <strong>A team needs a leader</strong></p>, <p>- <strong>Consequences are important to maintain order and structure</strong> </p>, <p>- <strong>In the end, the team is the most important thing, not winning, after them Winning is the most important thing</strong></p>, <p>- <strong>Understand what is required to win, then do it +1</strong></p>, <p><strong>Becoming a product creator</strong></p>, <p>Writing code is different from creating products, and that's why it may be difficult to understand what a product creator is.</p>, <p>a product creator is simply a person who has understood that code is not all it takes to build a good product.</p>, <p>coding is the easier thing to do, and having been developing for 4+ years, it's still hard to accept, but must be accepted.</p>, <p>When you have an idea and you want to have it become a product, it's important to understand the following.</p>, <p>- <strong>What problem am I trying to solve</strong></p>, <p>- <strong>Who are the users (remember this is not the whole world, it's just a very few people)</strong></p>, <p>- <strong>Why would they use it</strong></p>, <p>- <strong>what is the most important thing it is supposed to do</strong> - this is what you MAP (Minimum Awesome Product) is, only that most important thing</p>, <p>The questions you should avoid early on are questions like</p>, <p><a href=\"https://hngi6.slack.com/archives/CMGMWJE49/p1569509169357300\">15:46</a></p>, <p>- What language should I use?</p>, <p>- Is angular better than react for this?</p>, <p>- etc</p>, <p> I hope you know what I mean.</p>, <p>Most products today are not going to be MVPs anymore if you are going to build something make it awesome, it's the very first version. thus the idea of the MAP</p>, <p>to learn more from other product creators and coders becoming creators, check out indiehackers by Courtland</p>, <p>There would find other developers who have gone beyond just coding, but are now building their own products, and learning new things like growth, customer acquisition, traction and and its various metrics e.t.c</p>, <p><strong>Why I created Legohackers.</strong></p>, <p> This is quite simple, I created Legohackers with the intention to help other developers graduate from just being coders, into product creators, it's being a bit rough, in its growth because I'm learning as I improve it and I'm getting to know more about the users the more it grows and runs.</p>, <p>fun facts, most people don't build products simply because they don't find themselves in scenarios where they are to build products, and usually, this is because they may only know one of the skills they need to work with, and they may need help from others who are interested in the idea.</p>, <p>so in the last few weeks, I took legohackers offline, to deliberate on some ideas for the platform and what I intend to do about that problem. at the moment the platform is back online, and I want to have it become a part of this community. That's why I'm making it open-source by the ending of October, when I've met enough people interested in building it into something more.</p>, <p>so here's the idea. (edited) </p>, <p>Legohackers, would be extended into possibly <strong>the first online hackathon platform focused on product creation</strong>.</p>, <p>Every week/month depending on their ranking, developers would be divided into teams, with the aim of building products to solve certain problems, keep in mind products, so its not just about solving the problems but also about its <strong>design</strong>,<strong>usability</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>seo</strong>, <strong>quality</strong></p>, <p>product would be judged by the community and the highest-ranking can get prices and even take their products to market if they want to, cause the problems we would target would be real problems.</p>, <p>that's just what I'm thinking.</p>, <p><strong>Things to focus on to improve your skills</strong> So let improve our skills, what do we need to do.</p>, <p>We can start with the following.</p>, <p>- <strong>Become an essentialist</strong> - Do one thing at a time, and master ( truely master ) one thing at a time, We are in a field that allows us to be smart and lazy, make good use of that opportunity</p>, <p>- <strong>Don't rush</strong> - be it your process, your techniques, your project, and everything, don't rush yourself, plan well, and execute your plans, this is really important, the more you attempt to plan well, you get better at it and soon you wouldn't need to worry much about how you are doing, cause you would naturally go upwards.</p>, <p>- <strong>Know your destination, avoid hype or think well about it</strong> - I can say this because I fell for hype a lot, trust me, hype is both good and bad, but understand when it's real for you, and don't just jump in because others are doing it.</p>, <p>- <strong>Create buffers for yourself in everything</strong> - Buffers are extra room for yourself to gain control, be it as you are thinking or as you are working, or as you need more time, buffers are important, especially with time, we humans are ridiculously bad with estimating how much time things take, 2 hours tasks can take 4, and that's why buffers are important.</p>, <p>- <strong>When you work or study, Work or study / When you are playing, don't worry about work </strong>- nothing else, it's an ethic that would get you far. Give everything it's time.</p>, <p>I'm open to questions if you have any, I hope it wasn't too much.</p>, <p>Q: Where you the one who did both the frontend and backend of the project?</p>, <p>A: Yes, I built both the frontend and backend of legohackers. But I used tools where important, you cannot kill yourself.</p>, <p>Q: I feel pulled in too many directions, I dont know which language to focus on</p>, <p>A: Start with the one you found easier to understand, but first of all read about the languages, not the languages themselves, to learn what the creators were thinking of when they created them, then you'd know if you really want to learn that language.</p>, <p>Q: Many thanks for taking out  time to talk to us. I want to ask what the business plan is for legohacks. That's if I spell the name correctly. How do you intend to make money from the product.</p>, <p>A: I have thought of it too, but I decided to stop thinking about that, because I didn't build the project originally because of the monetary gains. It was something I wanted to see out there, as a software developer building a product means you can build more than one. here's another product I'm working on. this is focused on monetary gains, as well as delivering good service.<a href=\"https://spincrowwebsite.firebaseapp.com/\">https://spincrowwebsite.firebaseapp.com</a>, If legohackers is to make money, it would be from Ads maybe via Carbon, of from the competitions themselves. as some would have a cash price and entrance fee attached. but this is far into the future.</p>, <p>Q: what kind of tools please... cause I usually fall in this doo-it-all trap</p>, <p>A: Have you heard of templates from bootstrap, I like to use tools i understand well, so I use bootstrap a freaking lot, and I know it A to Z any project I get I'm going to go bootstrap, because it's good for prototyping as well as building wonderful UI, and it has stood the test of time. so I used bootstrap for the platform, also I frequently create boiler plate projects which I use to start other projects, you can find them on github</p>, <p>Q: you made mention of concentrating in one language, what if you are building a product and the language you know is not sufficient enough to build that product, what do you do?</p>, <p>A: Building a full product alone takes time and some very real focus. You have to take the time to really understand what you are trying to do, how to use different languages and possibly deploying the system alone. That's why you have to ask the important questions, like, what language can I really use for this. that would allow me do both the frontend and the back end with ease (Javascript <img alt=\":man-shrugging::skin-tone-4:\" src=\"https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/google-medium/1f937-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f@2x.png\"/>), I need to build a good frontend and I would need good templates for it ( <a href=\"http://www.creative-tim.com/\">www.creative-tim.com</a> <img alt=\":man-shrugging::skin-tone-4:\" src=\"https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/google-medium/1f937-1f3fd-200d-2642-fe0f@2x.png\"/>, the dude creates reusable templates in their hundreds )</p>, <p>Q: Does it mean I can not become full-stack,In terms of mastering one thing?</p>, <p>A: It's one at a time, you can get there, but make it easy for yourself, if you know javascript for frontend, you can easily learn node, and if you know node, you'll likely understand REST, and the design patterns that come along, e.g MVC, Class first systems etc, If you know design patterns, you'll likely be able to understand what PHP, C# or Golang is used for, and can go ahead to learn any of them if you what to.</p>, <p>it's a step by step process, and if you want to get there you can, more easily if you <strong>master one at a time</strong></p>, <p><strong>Q:</strong> also if you are in a collaborative project and the language of the group is quite different from the one you know what do you do? will you start to learn the language of the group or just quit the project?</p>, <p>A: Quit the project because you may not really have a useful place in it if you are there to learn that technology, stick around and learn as much as you can, but don't get in their way of accomplishing stuff. no one want's that guy that says I can do it, then takes one month, because he was reading docs.</p>, <p>A: Becoming a product developer drove me into coding...  How much of the language do I have to learn to finally kickoffStanding in front of judges to pitch my product had shot me to different areasWhat do I really focus on, and does design pattern really mean?</p>, <p>A: You don't need to know too much, just enough to start working on your ideas, you can master the rest as you move on, When pitching your ideas, it's about the key points, what exactly they need to know. If you can't talk well, find someone that has more oratory competence. there's no shame in seeking for help.</p>, <p>lastly design patterns, are solutions to common problems in software development, e.g how is session handled, how is authentication commonly built, how caching works, how to properly use inheritance. <strong>think of it as knowing your guns in call of duty</strong> wrong weapon can easily get you in trouble</p>, <p>Q: Do you have employees?</p>, <p>What do you look out for in an applicant?</p>, <p>What makes someone standout in your eyes as per potentials and vibes</p>, <p>A: this is an interesting one, yes I have had some people work with me, or for me before, (employees), and If I'm looking to work with someone, I like to make sure of the following.</p>, <p>- Do they understand me?</p>, <p>- Do they know what they are doing?</p>, <p><a href=\"https://hngi6.slack.com/archives/CMGMWJE49/p1569512939461000\">16:48</a></p>, <p>- Can they work under pressure if it calls for it?</p>, <p>- Can they make calculative decisions without me?</p>, <p><a href=\"https://hngi6.slack.com/archives/CMGMWJE49/p1569512971462400\">16:49</a></p>, <p>if the first 2 are good, the last two are seriously important</p>, <p>testing these is another case, for example I hate asking people to write code as a test</p>, <p><a href=\"https://hngi6.slack.com/archives/CMGMWJE49/p1569513068464800\">16:51</a></p>, <p>instead I'd prefer them showing me that they've built. or done in the past, and explain their thinking process. and I might even get into an argument with them to see how well they can defend their decisions.</p>, <p>Q: Do you know any site / books offering concrete step by step guide for front-end and back-end developers ?</p>, <p>A: I was trying to share my google drive for the books that could help, but let me reference them</p>, <p> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wZqgIT4pCkNCGh7004mtu43NZS5xry42?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wZqgIT4pCkNCGh7004mtu43NZS5xry42?usp=sharing</a> These are a few books I used earlier to keep the knowledge fresh.</p>, <p>Q: Pls I think am stock in this rush thing. Pls, can u explain it more and how to avoid this it?</p>, <p>A: When we try to learn new things because we see it as the in thing, we make mistakes in our learning process and forget it takes time to learn something, so we start without thinking of how much time it would take to fully master it. And then we become defunct in our thinking and understanding, of the topic, we start feeling sad, and something new comes up and we start the cycle again, what if we just stop, and look at one thing and go like, okay I think I need this thing, and learn only that thing and use it for a year, (your time limit, before you leave anything to learn something else), if you do well, you would have mastered something enough to go for the second year and then the third, while picking up other important things in the process.</p>]\n"

have or would love to have lucid installed on your domain?', \"click the button below to follow me\\n home  /\\n             blog  / q&a with chibuike ositahey guys, it's nice to be hereso my name is chibuike emmanuel osita, but in the community and generally, i'm more commonly known as mozart, i'm a software engineer and a proud aluminai of this internship.\", \"so i'm really happy to be in this space again.in order to ensure this is organized, i'll talk about the following before the questions.- why i became a developer- what i learned from the internship- becoming a product creator- why i created legohackers- things to focus on to improve your skills.why i became a developerlet's start from the beginning very briefly, i wanted to be an aeronautics engineer, a since i was little, aside becoming spiderman, it's the only thing i found myself thinking about constantly.\", \"until my dad got i and my brother our first computer, it was a compaq presario cq57, pretty old stuff, but it was the beginning for me, i spent a lot of time tinkering with it, installing games and deleting them.eventually, i started trying to edit them, i failed miserably, but i learned a little about what programs were, when got into secondary school i met a guy called izuchukuw, who game me some ideas about programming, i could remember this well because he open youtube one day and told he hacked the internet to view the videos and i freaking believed him\\xa0, since then it's been me and computers and programming just felt right.before i got into programming actively was about a year after secondary school and i wanted to learn how the world works and an objective look at myself made me understand that i wanted to do this.\", 'as a career, so i worked at computer village for a year, before writing jamb for computer science and i got the admission.', \"but the school (futo) didn't teach what i was expecting, so i started actively training myself, right around the first year.i started with c++, one 1 hour everyday for a year, and then java before getting into web developmenti wouldn't recommend this route though, all it did for me was to give me some grounded understanding.if there was anything i would have done differently,- i would have focused on learning more about what the languages themselves could be used for- focused more on design patterns- mastering singular technologiesthe key is to know exactly what you want from your career as a developer and what it would mean for you.\", \"for example, because of my enthusiasm, i learned different languages, some of which i didn't use at all (e.g c++), i did get to learn design patterns later, but i always felt i should have started somewhere around there in order to understand the bigger picture.singular technologies are all things related to a singular language and it's frameworks, it's everything that concerns the language you are working on, e.g php and laravel, if you know php, master it and master laravel , so everything concerning it as a language and its framework is in your circle of control and understanding.at the end though, i'm happy about my path, but if you follow the key points, you'll likely get to your ideas faster.before i end this sections (why i became a developer) though, just have the following in mind.- don't just follow buzzwords, at the end, all of these technologies are the same.- and the simplest solution or language to understand and use is most likely the best for you (occam's razor)- focus on the essentials, (is it understandable, does it work, how soon can i get up and running)the essentials may be different for you, but always keep them in mind.what i learnt from the internshipthe internship started when i just finished my second year in school, the third semester was just beginning, we were more than a thousand, and i really loved it15:32before then i had known only a few other developers, but with the internship, i mad a new opportunity to meet some really ingenious people.\", \"we collaborated, fought argued and learnt together and it made me understand the following points.-\\xa0a team would only work if it's members are working\\xa0-\\xa0the leader of the team understand the problem, before the members can get to work-\\xa0a team needs a leader-\\xa0consequences are important to maintain order and structure\\xa0-\\xa0in the end, the team is the most important thing, not winning, after them winning is the most important thing-\\xa0understand what is required to win, then do it +1becoming a product creatorwriting code is different from creating products, and that's why it may be difficult to understand what a product creator is.a product creator is simply a person who has understood that code is not all it takes to build a good product.coding is the easier thing to do, and having been developing for 4+ years, it's still hard to accept, but must be accepted.when you have an idea and you want to have it become a product, it's important to understand the following.-\\xa0what problem am i trying to solve-\\xa0who are the users (remember this is not the whole world, it's just a very few people)-\\xa0why would they use it-\\xa0what is the most important thing it is supposed to do\\xa0- this is what you map (minimum awesome product) is, only that most important thingthe questions you should avoid early on are questions like15:46- what language should i use?- is angular better than react for this?- etc\\xa0i hope you know what i mean.most products today are not going to be mvps anymore if you are going to build something make it awesome, it's the very first version.\", 'thus the idea of the mapto learn more from other product creators and coders becoming creators, check out indiehackers by courtlandthere would find other developers who have gone beyond just coding, but are now building their own products, and learning new things like growth, customer acquisition, traction and and its various metrics e.t.cwhy i created legohackers.', \"this is quite simple, i created legohackers with the intention to help other developers graduate from just being coders, into product creators, it's being a bit rough, in its growth because i'm learning as i improve it and i'm getting to know more about the users the more it grows and runs.fun facts, most people don't build products simply because they don't find themselves in scenarios where they are to build products, and usually, this is because they may only know one of the skills they need to work with, and they may need help from others who are interested in the idea.so in the last few weeks, i took legohackers offline, to deliberate on some ideas for the platform and what i intend to do about that problem.\", 'at the moment the platform is back online, and i want to have it become a part of this community.', \"that's why i'm making it open-source by the ending of october, when i've met enough people interested in building it into something more.so here's the idea.\", \"(edited)\\xa0legohackers, would be extended into possibly\\xa0the first online hackathon platform focused on product creation.every week/month depending on their ranking, developers would be divided into teams, with the aim of building products to solve certain problems, keep in mind products, so its not just about solving the problems but also about its\\xa0design,usability,\\xa0performance,\\xa0seo,\\xa0qualityproduct would be judged by the community and the highest-ranking can get prices and even take their products to market if they want to, cause the problems we would target would be real problems.that's just what i'm thinking.things to focus on to improve your skills\\xa0so let improve our skills, what do we need to do.we can start with the following.-\\xa0become an essentialist\\xa0- do one thing at a time, and master ( truely master ) one thing at a time, we are in a field that allows us to be smart and lazy, make good use of that opportunity-\\xa0don't rush\\xa0- be it your process, your techniques, your project, and everything, don't rush yourself, plan well, and execute your plans, this is really important, the more you attempt to plan well, you get better at it and soon you wouldn't need to worry much about how you are doing, cause you would naturally go upwards.-\\xa0know your destination, avoid hype or think well about it\\xa0- i can say this because i fell for hype a lot, trust me, hype is both good and bad, but understand when it's real for you, and don't just jump in because others are doing it.-\\xa0create buffers for yourself in everything\\xa0- buffers are extra room for yourself to gain control, be it as you are thinking or as you are working, or as you need more time, buffers are important, especially with time, we humans are ridiculously bad with estimating how much time things take, 2 hours tasks can take 4, and that's why buffers are important.-\\xa0when you work or study, work or study / when you are playing, don't worry about work\\xa0- nothing else, it's an ethic that would get you far.\", \"give everything it's time.i'm open to questions if you have any, i hope it wasn't too much.q: where you the one who did both the frontend and backend of the project?a: yes, i built both the frontend and backend of legohackers.\", \"but i used tools where important, you cannot kill yourself.q: i feel pulled in too many directions, i dont know which language to focus ona: start with the one you found easier to understand, but first of all read about the languages, not the languages themselves, to learn what the creators were thinking of when they created them, then you'd know if you really want to learn that language.q: many thanks for taking out\\xa0\\xa0time to talk to us.\", 'i want to ask what the business plan is for legohacks.', \"that's if i spell the name correctly.\", \"how do you intend to make money from the product.a: i have thought of it too, but i decided to stop thinking about that, because i didn't build the project originally because of the monetary gains.\", 'it was something i wanted to see out there, as a software developer building a product means you can build more than one.', \"here's another product i'm working on.\", 'this is focused on monetary gains, as well as delivering good service.https://spincrowwebsite.firebaseapp.com, if legohackers is to make money, it would be from ads maybe via carbon, of from the competitions themselves.', 'as some would have a cash price and entrance fee attached.', \"but this is far into the future.q: what kind of tools please... cause i usually fall in this doo-it-all trapa: have you heard of templates from bootstrap, i like to use tools i understand well, so i use bootstrap a freaking lot, and i know it a to z any project i get i'm going to go bootstrap, because it's good for prototyping as well as building wonderful ui, and it has stood the test of time.\", 'so i used bootstrap for the platform, also i frequently create boiler plate projects which i use to start other projects, you can find them on githubq: you made mention of concentrating in one language, what if you are building a product and the language you know is not sufficient enough to build that product, what do you do?a: building a full product alone takes time and some very real focus.', 'you have to take the time to really understand what you are trying to do, how to use different languages and possibly deploying the system alone.', \"that's why you

      "[\"but the school (futo) didn't teach what i was expecting, so i started actively training myself, right around the first year.i started with c++, one 1 hour everyday for a year, and then java before getting into web developmenti wouldn't recommend this route though, all it did for me was to give me some grounded understanding.if there was anything i would have done differently,- i would have focused on learning more about what the languages themselves could be used for- focused more on design patterns- mastering singular technologiesthe key is to know exactly what you want from your career as a developer and what it would mean for you.\", \"for example, because of my enthusiasm, i learned different languages, some of which i didn't use at all (e.g c++), i did get to learn design patterns later, but i always felt i should have started somewhere around there in order to understand the bigger picture.singular technologies are all things related to a singular language and it's frameworks, it's everything that concerns the language you are working on, e.g php and laravel, if you know php, master it and master laravel , so everything concerning it as a language and its framework is in your circle of control and understanding.at the end though, i'm happy about my path, but if you follow the key points, you'll likely get to your ideas faster.before i end this sections (why i became a developer) though, just have the following in mind.- don't just follow buzzwords, at the end, all of these technologies are the same.- and the simplest solution or language to understand and use is most likely the best for you (occam's razor)- focus on the essentials, (is it understandable, does it work, how soon can i get up and running)the essentials may be different for you, but always keep them in mind.what i learnt from the internshipthe internship started when i just finished my second year in school, the third semester was just beginning, we were more than a thousand, and i really loved it15:32before then i had known only a few other developers, but with the internship, i mad a new opportunity to meet some really ingenious people.\", \"we collaborated, fought argued and learnt together and it made me understand the following points.-\\xa0a team would only work if it's members are working\\xa0-\\xa0the leader of the team understand the problem, before the members can get to work-\\xa0a team needs a leader-\\xa0consequences are important to maintain order and structure\\xa0-\\xa0in the end, the team is the most important thing, not winning, after them winning is the most important thing-\\xa0understand what is required to win, then do it +1becoming a product creatorwriting code is different from creating products, and that's why it may be difficult to understand what a product creator is.a product creator is simply a person who has understood that code is not all it takes to build a good product.coding is the easier thing to do, and having been developing for 4+ years, it's still hard to accept, but must be accepted.when you have an idea and you want to have it become a product, it's important to understand the following.-\\xa0what problem am i trying to solve-\\xa0who are the users (remember this is not the whole world, it's just a very few people)-\\xa0why would they use it-\\xa0what is the most important thing it is supposed to do\\xa0- this is what you map (minimum awesome product) is, only that most important thingthe questions you should avoid early on are questions like15:46- what language should i use?- is angular better than react for this?- etc\\xa0i hope you know what i mean.most products today are not going to be mvps anymore if you are going to build something make it awesome, it's the very first version.\", \"this is quite simple, i created legohackers with the intention to help other developers graduate from just being coders, into product creators, it's being a bit rough, in its growth because i'm learning as i improve it and i'm getting to know more about the users the more it grows and runs.fun facts, most people don't build products simply because they don't find themselves in scenarios where they are to build products, and usually, this is because they may only know one of the skills they need to work with, and they may need help from others who are interested in the idea.so in the last few weeks, i took legohackers offline, to deliberate on some ideas for the platform and what i intend to do about that problem.\", \"(edited)\\xa0legohackers, would be extended into possibly\\xa0the first online hackathon platform focused on product creation.every week/month depending on their ranking, developers would be divided into teams, with the aim of building products to solve certain problems, keep in mind products, so its not just about solving the problems but also about its\\xa0design,usability,\\xa0performance,\\xa0seo,\\xa0qualityproduct would be judged by the community and the highest-ranking can get prices and even take their products to market if they want to, cause the problems we would target would be real problems.that's just what i'm thinking.things to focus on to improve your skills\\xa0so let improve our skills, what do we need to do.we can start with the following.-\\xa0become an essentialist\\xa0- do one thing at a time, and master ( truely master ) one thing at a time, we are in a field that allows us to be smart and lazy, make good use of that opportunity-\\xa0don't rush\\xa0- be it your process, your techniques, your project, and everything, don't rush yourself, plan well, and execute your plans, this is really important, the more you attempt to plan well, you get better at it and soon you wouldn't need to worry much about how you are doing, cause you would naturally go upwards.-\\xa0know your destination, avoid hype or think well about it\\xa0- i can say this because i fell for hype a lot, trust me, hype is both good and bad, but understand when it's real for you, and don't just jump in because others are doing it.-\\xa0create buffers for yourself in everything\\xa0- buffers are extra room for yourself to gain control, be it as you are thinking or as you are working, or as you need more time, buffers are important, especially with time, we humans are ridiculously bad with estimating how much time things take, 2 hours tasks can take 4, and that's why buffers are important.-\\xa0when you work or study, work or study / when you are playing, don't worry about work\\xa0- nothing else, it's an ethic that would get you far.\", \"but i used tools where important, you cannot kill yourself.q: i feel pulled in too many directions, i dont know which language to focus ona: start with the one you found easier to understand, but first of all read about the languages, not the languages themselves, to learn what the creators were thinking of when they created them, then you'd know if you really want to learn that language.q: many thanks for taking out\\xa0\\xa0time to talk to us.\", 'so i used bootstrap for the platform, also i frequently create boiler plate projects
